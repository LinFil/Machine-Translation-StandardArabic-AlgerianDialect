# Machine-Translation-StandardArabic-AlgerianDialect
Developed a deep learning model for bidirectional translation between Standard Arabic and the Algerian dialect using TensorFlow. This project involved dataset creation, implementing a seq-to-seq model with attention, and data preprocessing. Results were promising but indicate potential for further improvement in translation accuracy.
